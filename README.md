 Prompts the user to choose from a list of matrix operations. From there, they can choose the dimensions of their matrix and the elements that constitute it. The chosen operation will then be carried out and the result will be printed. Upon completion, the main selection screen will re appear- allowing further calculations to be performed at the userâ€™s convenience. The program features operations such as addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication, and inverse calculation; it is written using object oriented programming in order to render the code as concise as possible. I decided to write this program after a semester in linear algebra. While I found the subject fascinating, I wanted to be able to perform the low level operations at a faster pace in order to get to the more theory oriented portions of the given question faster.
